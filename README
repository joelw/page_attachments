= Page Attachments

The Page Attachments extension allows Radiant administrators to attach files
to pages. It can also generate and display thumbnails of uploaded images if
image_science, mini-magick, or rmagick are installed on the server.

Install the extension and run 

 rake production db:migrate:extensions
 rake production radiant:extensions:page_attachments:update

When you login to your Radiant admin and edit a page, you should see an area
below the main interface that says “Attachments (0)”. Click the "+" icon to
add an attachment. You can upload multiple attachments at once. Attachments
will not be saved or removed until the whole page is saved. Therefore, if you
accidentally deleted something you meant to keep, simply cancel the page-edit.


 <r:attachment name="file.txt">...</r:attachment>
